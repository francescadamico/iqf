                    This project is conducted with three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometers providing wind speed, direction and temperature with a high temporal resolution (10 Hz). These anemometers were mounted on a 3 m high mast, except for the wall station (balcony) as shown on the pictures below. Around the sensor itself complementary equipment e.g. masts and mounting equipment, power supply and data acquisition systems were needed. Due to different conditions at the chosen measurement locations, on the one hand one data logger operating on an external battery is used. On the other hand five grid powered systems driven by a microcomputer (Raspberry Pi) were developed.

<h1>Project description</h1>

<p>The "IQF-Wind" project is actively involved in a joint project funded by the state Baden-Württemberg to investigate the potential of renewable energy at the university and hospital sites in Tübingen. This purpose is a follow-on project regarding a pre-investigation from the "Technisches Betriebsamt Tübingen (tba)" and the institute for physical geography & geoinformatics from the university of Tübingen, internally published in 2012.

Current project partners are the tba and the chair for physical geography & geoinformatics from the university of Tübingen. The detailed project schedule can be found on the Zeitplan_IQF_Projekt.pdf.

The geography group focuses on the calculation of the solar potential whether the tba will investigate mainly the broken down energy consumption of single buildings.

The umphy group will furthermore stress on a detailed study of the urban wind field including a spatial high resolved numerical simulation of the windfield at the university site at the Schnarrenberg (NWI) and at the hospital area in the same region (UKT). A large eddy simulation (LES) should be established using the open source software "openFOAM". In a second step temporal high resolved, three dimensional measurements of wind speed and wind direction should complement the study. On one hand the data should be used for determination of the inflow boundary conditions. Otherwise the wind data is going to be used for verifying the numerical model. The main goal of the study is to identify locations with the best conditions for converting kinetic wind energy into electrical energy using small (building-mounted) wind turbines. In a last step it is planned to take a small wind turbine into operation tentatively at a given location.

The final results should wind up in a visualized comprehensive report (i.e. a map) in close cooperation with the other groups. Associated interfaces for a data exchange with the other groups should therefore be established.
